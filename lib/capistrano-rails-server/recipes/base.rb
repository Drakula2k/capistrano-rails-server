      Prepares one or more servers for deployment. Before you can use any \
      of the Capistrano deployment tasks with your project, you will need to \
      make sure all of your servers have been prepared with `cap deploy:setup'. When \
      you add a new server to your cluster, you can easily run the setup task \
      on just that server by specifying the HOSTS environment variable:

        $ cap HOSTS=new.server.com deploy:setup

      It is safe to run this task on servers that have already been set up; it \
      will not destroy any deployed revisions or data.
